Welcome to my journey through the **SoC Tapeout Program VSD**!

This repository documents my **week-by-week progress** with tasks inside each week.

<div align="center">

> *"In this program, we learn to design a System-on-Chip (SoC) from basic RTL to GDSII using open-source tools. Part of India's largest collaborative RISC-V tapeout initiative, empowering 3500+ participants to build silicon and advance the nation's semiconductor ecosystem."*

## 📅 **Week 1 — RTL Design and Synthesis Foundations**

<summary><b>🔑 Week 1: RTL Coding, Synthesis, and Optimization Concepts</b></summary>

This week focused on building strong fundamentals in **Verilog RTL design** and exploring synthesis techniques for both combinational and sequential circuits.

### 📖 **Daily Progress**

* **Day 1** → *Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis*

  * Basics of RTL modeling
  * Introduction to synthesis flow
  * Hands-on RTL design examples

* **Day 2** → *Timing Libraries, Hierarchical vs. Flat Synthesis, and Efficient Flop Coding Styles*

  * Role of timing libraries in synthesis
  * Hierarchical vs. flat synthesis trade-offs
  * Best practices for flip-flop coding

* **Day 3** → *Combinational and Sequential Optimization*

  * Logic simplification techniques
  * Multi-level optimization strategies
  * Sequential circuit optimization methods

* **Day 4** → *GLS, Blocking vs. Non-Blocking, and Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch*

  * Gate-Level Simulation workflow
  * Difference between blocking (`=`) and non-blocking (`<=`) assignments
  * Debugging synthesis-simulation mismatches

* **Day 5** → *Optimization in Synthesis*

  * Constant propagation
  * State optimization in FSMs
  * Retiming and cloning techniques

### 🌟 **Key Learnings from Week 1**

* Developed a strong grasp of RTL-to-synthesis flow
* Understood timing libraries and their role in achieving design closure
* Learned pitfalls of blocking assignments and how to avoid mismatches
* Gained exposure to advanced synthesis optimization techniques
